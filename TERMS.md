# ðŸ“ƒ **Terms & Conditions**

By using [https://skribo.link](https://skribo.link) (later on, "the app"), these terms, will automatically apply to you â€“ you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. I encourage you to give the Privacy Policy a careful look.

- Privacy Policy can be found [here](./PRIVACY.md).
- License can be found [here](./LICENSE.md).

Oleksii Besida, the developer of the app (will be referenced as "me", "I") committed to ensure that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, I reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. I will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what youâ€™re paying for.

The Skribo app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to it, to provide the app's Service. Itâ€™s your responsibility to keep your device and access to the app secure. I therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phoneâ€™s security features and it could mean that the Skribo app wonâ€™t work properly or at all.

You should be aware that there are certain things that I will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but I cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you donâ€™t have access to Wi-Fi, and you donâ€™t have any of your data allowance left.

If youâ€™re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using the app, youâ€™re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which youâ€™re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.

Along the same lines, I cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged â€“ if it runs out of battery and you canâ€™t turn it on to avail the Service, Oleksii Besida cannot accept responsibility.

At some point, I may wish to update the app.

## Changes to This Terms and Conditions

I may update the app's Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.
