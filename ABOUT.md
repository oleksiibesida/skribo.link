## Skribo

Skribo is a free platform that allows users to assign a link to a picture or a paragraph that can be shared with others who have to "scratch it off" to see it.

The idea of the app is to make the sharing experience more interactive, so the receiver can take deeper attention to the content they received. 

You can add a title to your Skribo which is visible before the receiver starts to scratch dust off. The app allows you to choose a theme from a variety. Skribos have a timer, after which the content is deleted from servers.

To try go ahead and upload an image from the gallery or just type something or both. Optionally assign it a theme, title, and custom timeout. After that, you can copy a link or download a QR code.

After the receiver opens a page with your Skribo, they will see the title and a tip to scratch your content off. Together with that, they can reply to your Skribo.

You can review your previously created Skribos in Your Skribos modal, together with the replies you received. To view detailed information, preview, or delete the Skribo, tap on it to see the management modal.
